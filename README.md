This is my take on the library management system . Users can start at the main menu and select options 1-3.
1 takes the user too the book operations ,2 take the user too the user operations and 3 should quit the menu 
while in book main options are 1-6 ,1  you can add a book into SQL table ,2/3 Borrow and return a book takes the 
book from the library and you can return it ,4 allows you too search for a book in the sql file by id ,5 lets you 
look at the available and unavailable books in SQl table, 6 allows the user too go back too the main menu !
option 2 allows users too go to o the user menu options 1-4 1 allows users to make a new user 
, 2 lets users find a user by id ,3 will show all users in the SQL table users and 4 will send you back to main menu !
